# HIVE Streamlit app

This repository contains code for a streamlit-based web app used for demonstrating our HIVE simulation/surrogate system.

The code can be run with 
```bash
# you may wish to optionally create a new environment
pip install -r requirements.txt # maybe I missed some requirements
streamlit run app.py
```
